# uuidminer

Ever wondered which Minecraft player name would make a miner proud? Maybe something with an ultra-rare UUID full of leading zeros ‚Äî like a digital diamond...

This project digs deep into the player name mines, brute-forcing through names to find that rare offline mode UUID with the most leading zeros. Think of it as [proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) for Minecraft names... but just for fun!

## üèÜ The Most Difficult Names

| Length | Name              | UUID                                   | Leading Zeros |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 3      | `ign`             | `00006dae-4a2b-3a71-8473-11a2d1553f3f` | 4             |
| 4      | `v4K4`            | `00000109-807f-3287-9a54-90aa57e7362a` | 5             |
| 5      | `16j63`           | `00000003-a5f8-3217-96d2-c96c3f60529c` | 7             |
| 6      | `EhxMb9`          | `00000000-27ce-35d0-b1ca-15b8d6f93fbf` | 8             |
| 7      | `tiHSNRY`         | `00000000-0002-3ff2-bda6-bf24a74ffc4e` | 11            |
| 8      | _Still mining..._ | _What will it be?_                     | ?             |

This entire project was run on a single, humble RTX 3080 GPU. So, if you're waiting for the results for 8-character names and beyond‚Ä¶ well, let's just say it might be a while. Perhaps forever!

But hey, let‚Äôs not take this project too seriously. It‚Äôs all in good fun ‚Äî a little (okay, a lot) of number-crunching in the name of Minecraft ‚Äúdifficulty.‚Äù So grab a snack, enjoy the results, and let this project bring a smile to your face.
