# uuidminer

Ever wondered which Minecraft player name would make a miner proud? Maybe something with an ultra-rare UUID full of leading zeros ‚Äî like a digital diamond...

This project digs deep into the player name mines, brute-forcing through names to find that rare offline mode UUID with the most leading zeros. Think of it as [proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) for Minecraft names... but just for fun!

## üèÜ The Most Difficult Names

| Length | Name              | UUID                                   | Leading Zeros |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 3      | `ign`             | `00006dae-4a2b-3a71-4473-11a2d155bf3f` | 4             |
| 4      | `01Hj`            | `00009935-6096-31d0-f93e-bbde801aba91` | 4             |
| 5      | `_VsG3`           | `0000091a-5712-3e5b-8f58-bf98c81fbb33` | 4             |
| 6      | `__ZyD2`          | `00000725-6651-3fbf-a5ce-1c58e4259306` | 4             |
| 7      | _Still mining..._ | _What will it be?_                     | ?             |

This entire project was run on a single, humble RTX 3080 GPU. So, if you're waiting for the results for 7-character names and beyond‚Ä¶ well, let's just say it might be a while. Perhaps forever!

But hey, let‚Äôs not take this project too seriously. It‚Äôs all in good fun‚Äîa little (okay, a lot) of number-crunching in the name of Minecraft ‚Äúdifficulty.‚Äù So grab a snack, enjoy the results, and let this project bring a smile to your face. After all, isn't that what Minecraft mining is really all about? (Well, that and diamonds, of course!)
